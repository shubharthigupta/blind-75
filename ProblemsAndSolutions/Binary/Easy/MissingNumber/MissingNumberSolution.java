    Solution Description :
    ----------------------

    This problem can be solved in multiple ways with a time complexity of O(n).
    However, we need to keep in mind that the space complexity needs to be O(1).

    Let's resolve this using binary operations.
    Before discussing the solutions, few things we need to know about the XOR operation :
    For any number n, m and k,
    - Number XORed with itself, returns 0 =>    n ^ n = 0
    - Number XORed with 0, returns itself =>    n ^ 0 = n
    - Order of XORing does not matter. =>       n ^ m ^ k = n ^ k ^ m = m ^ n ^ k

    Using this we can think of a solution.
    For a given array arr[n] having n digits between 0 and n,
    if we put all the digits and the indices through XOR operation, then the output will give us the missing number.

    For example, arr = {0,1,5,4,2}
    Now, the length of the array is 5 and it contains numbers between 0 to 5.
    If we XOR all the digits in the array along with the indices, all the common elements will cancel out to give 0
    and 0 XORed with the missing element, will give out the missing element.
    => (0 ^ 1 ^ 5 ^ 4 ^ 2) ^ (0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5)
    => (0 ^ 0) ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (2 ^ 2) ^ (3) ^ (4 ^ 4) ^ (5 ^ 5)
    => 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 3 ^ 0 ^ 0
    => 3
    So, we see, we got the missing element.

    Line 6 :
    We set the result as 0. In case of an empty array, we will return 0.

    Line 7 :
    Since we have already set the initial value of result as 0, we will start the loop from 1
    and will go till the length of the array as we need to consider it in our calculation.
    Here, think of i as the total number of elements in the array considered in that iteration instead of the array index.
    For example, for 2nd index of the array, we are considering 3 elements in total. So, index is 2 but i will be 3 here.

    Line 8 :
    We use the short hand operator to set the new result as previous result ^ i ^ nums[i-1]

    Line 10 :
    Finally we return result which holds the missing number.
