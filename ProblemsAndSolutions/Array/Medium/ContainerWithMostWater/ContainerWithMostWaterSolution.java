    Solution Description :
    ----------------------

    Consider this as a graph with indices on the x-axis and the array element values on the y-  .
    We need to find the maximum possible area on this graph which will essentially represent the maximum volume of water that can be contained.

                    L                           R

    Line 6-8 :
    This is a two-pointer problem. We set the result as 0.
    We set the left pointer at index 0 and the right one at the last index.

    Line 9 :
    We start the loop and it goes till the left pointer is smaller than the right one.

    Line 10 :
    We check the length of the initial area first. This can be calculated by subtracting the left pointer from the right one.
    We got the length, now let's find the height.
    This is equal to the minimum of the values at these left and right pointer.
    For example, in the above graph, if the left pointer is at index 1 and the right pointer is at index 8, then
    length = 8 - 1 = 7
    height = minimum of (array[1], array[8]) = 7
    Area = 7 * 7 = 49
    We store the maximum result between the area obtained in the current iteration and the previous ones.

    Line 11-15 :
    If the value of the element at the left pointer is smaller than the right one, we increment the left pointer by 1, i.e., move the left pointer to the immediate right index.
    Else, we decrement the right pointer, i.e., move it to the immediate left index.

    Line 17 :
    We return the result which holds the maximum area obtained from all the iterations.
