## 🧠 Search in Rotated Sorted Array2

---

### 📘 Problem Statement:

> There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct values**) and then rotated at an unknown pivot index.
> Given the array and a target value, return the **index** of the target if it is in the array, or `-1` if it is not found.


### 📌 Example:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```


### 🔒 Constraints:

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
* `-10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
* All values in `nums` are **unique**
* `nums` is a rotated array originally sorted in ascending order
* `-10⁴ <= target <= 10⁴`

---

## ✅ Key Idea:

This is a **modified binary search** problem due to the rotation. The key is to determine **which half of the array is sorted**, and narrow the search accordingly:

1. Start with `left = 0`, `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left <= right`, calculate `mid` index.
3. If `nums[mid] == target` → return `mid`.
4. Determine which half is sorted:

    * If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]` → left half is sorted

        * Check if `target` lies in left half
    * Else → right half is sorted

        * Check if `target` lies in right half
5. Narrow the search window accordingly.
6. If loop ends → target not found → return `-1`.


## 💡 Notes to Memorize:

* This is a **binary search with rotation logic**.
* The key observation is that **at least one half (left or right) will always be sorted**.
* Use the sorted half to decide which direction to discard.

### 🛠️ High-Level Steps:

* Initialize `left = 0`, `right = nums.length - 1`.
* While `left <= right`:

    * Calculate `mid = (left + right) / 2`
    * If `nums[mid] == target`, return `mid`
    * Determine if left half is sorted:

        * If target lies within it → shift right pointer
        * Else → shift left pointer
* If not found → return `-1`


### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` — Efficient binary search
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — No extra space used
